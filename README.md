# Introduction

There you have a set of advanced exercises implemented in JS.
In this set of exercises you cand find few programming techniques, like recursivity solutions and linear solutions.


### Instructions

On the first hand, inside this project you can find the initial data set arrays and also a pair of auxiliar functions that are very useful in the executing process.

On the other hand you can also find the exercises separated by dotted lines with a brief explanation of them.

### Exercises

1. Find an element inside a concrete array given as a parameter
2. Clean a specified array and return the string
3. Calculation of the distance between two points a and b
4. Comparation between two arrays


## Execution

#### 1) How i initiate it?
You can clone it and work in your local repositorie with this command:
`git clone https://github.com/fjrf16/JS-Exercises-III`


#### 2) How do i test the code?

You can test the code from the call to the concrete function of the exercise in the final part of the exercise, uncommenting it. You can change the values of the parameters in the call as you like and see the results.
